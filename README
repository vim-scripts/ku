*ku* is a Vim plugin to provide new interface for Vim.  With ku,

- You can choose many items from various sources such as buffers, files and
  others.  This selection is very efficient, because ku supports it by
  automatic and elegant completion, so that you don't have to type much.

- Then you can take an action on the selected item.  Various actions are
  available for each kind of items.


To start a selection, execute |:Ku| or |ku#start()|.  |the-ku-window| will be
opened at the top of the current tabpage.  The window is to select items and
to do an action on a selected item.  In the window,

- |ins-completion-menu| is automatically appeared to show available items.
  As you input a character, the menu is updated to show more proper items for
  the given input.

  If you want to know how ku interpret what you input,
  see |ku-pattern|, |ku-auto-component-completion| and |ku-prefix-expansion|.

- If you find what you want in the menu, select it with <C-n> or <C-p>.  If
  the first item in the menu is what you want, you don't have to select it.

- Then you can take an action on the selected item with <Enter> or <Tab>.

  - With <Enter>, ku executes the default action for the item.

  - With <Tab>, ku shows a list of available actions for the item.  Each
    action is labeled with a key to execute it.  If you type one of the keys,
    the corresponding action will be executed.

  <Enter> and <Tab> are just the default key bindings.  You can customize
  them, of course.  See |ku-key-mappings| and |ku#default_key_mappings()|.
  If you want to customize key bindings in a list of actions by <Tab>, see
  |ku#custom_key()|, |ku-default-key-table| and |ku-key-table|.

- If you don't want to take any action and stop to select, type <C-c> in any
  mode.  The window is closed and the current tabpage is restored to the
  previous state.


In ku, a kind of items is called "source".  Some sources are available by
default.  See |ku-default-sources| for the details.  You can write your own
sources if you want to select and to take action on something which is not
provided by the default sources.  To add sources, put the corresponding
scripts into "autoload/ku/" directories in 'runtimepath'.  As scripts are put,
ku recognizes them automatically, so that you don't have to reboot Vim.  See
alsso |ku-sources| for the details.
